Update Log:
v0.3 (??????????)
 - Added stat saving on shutdown

 - Added some error checking on the device name, will now alert you to a problem instead of just flashing.

v0.2 (20/03/2008)
 - Added options to disable upload/download data so you can have two seperate graphs should you want to.
 - Added bit/byte display.
 - Added line-graph mode with the option to fill (Now the default as I think it looks nicer ;)
 - Added line-width option
 - Added configurable text, now YOU get to decide what info to display :)
 - Reworked the graph scaling, you can now overscale by a percentage and/or scale the graph to a certain size.
 - Changed the default colors to opaque so people without compositing can see things. (Damn you screenlets .12)
